# used (so that URLs can point to different servers while the servers don't need to support changing the app root).
# The che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property defines how the path of the ingress should be
# transformed to support the URL rewriting and this property defines the set of annotations on the ingress itself
# that instruct the chosen ingress controller to actually do the URL rewriting, potentially building on the path
# transformation (if required by the chosen ingress controller).
#

#     "ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout": "3600","ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout": "3600"}
# and the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform should be set to "%s(.*)"
#
# For nginx ingress controller older than 0.22.0, the rewrite-target should be set to merely "/" and the path transform
# to "%s" (see the the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property).

# must be a valid input to the String.format() method and contain exactly one reference to "%s".
#
# Please see the description of the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.annotations_json property to see how these two
# properties interplay when specifying the ingress annotations and path.

### Factory defaults

# Editor and plugin which will be used for factories which are created from remote git repository
# which doesn't contain any Che-specific workspace descriptors (like .devfile of .factory.json)

### Devfile defaults

# Default Editor that should be provisioned into Devfile if there is no specified Editor
# Format is `editorPublisher/editorName/editorVersion` value.

# Default Plugins which should be provisioned for Default Editor.
# All the plugins from this list that are not explicitly mentioned in the user-defined devfile
# will be provisioned but only when the default editor is used or if the user-defined editor is
# the same as the default one (even if in different version).
# Format is comma-separated `pluginPublisher/pluginName/pluginVersion` values, and URLs. For example:
# eclipse/che-theia-exec-plugin/0.0.1,eclipse/che-theia-terminal-plugin/0.0.1,https://cdn.pluginregistry.com/vi-mode/meta.yaml
# If the plugin is a URL, the plugin's meta.yaml is retrieved from that URL.
